### What does this block do for me?

**(1) Model Customer Experience Data** - All of your KARTE user activity tracking data in one place, pre-modeled, so you don't have to figure out how to organize data for analysis.

**(2) Expertise** - Leverage Plaid and Looker's expertise in web analytics and customer success through turnkey dashboards.

**(3) No DWH Setup** - This block is made to interact with KARTE's DataHub, a BigQuery-based user activity tracking database, so you don't have to use valuable engineering time to set up your data infrastructure.
